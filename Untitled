Phase B: The "Finish & Share" System
This creates the "Ready to Ship" moment.

Prompt for Cursor:

"I need to build the 'Finalize' flow.

Finish Button: Place a prominent 'Finish & Generate Gift' button at the bottom-middle of the left panel.

Packaging Data: When clicked, this button should serialize the 7-day canvas designs (JSON/Base64) and the lock-dates into a shareable URL or a database entry.

Share Modal: After clicking 'Finish', replace the editor panel with a 'Success' view. This view should feature a 'Copy Share Link' button and a preview of the unique gift URL for their friend."
